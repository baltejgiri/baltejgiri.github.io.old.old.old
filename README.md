# Hello World

Myself Baltej Giri and I am born and raise in Northern India; I moved to New Zealand after completing high school in India for higher education. I and my wife moved to Canada since 2016. I would like to welcome you to my portfolio where I showcase my unique journey to be a Computer Networking Expert.

I am enthusiastic about in all things about computers and networks. I have five years of experience in Information Technology with excellent communication skills.

Cisco Systems is my choice of vendor to follow their curriculum to assess my knowledge through their certifications. Currently mastering skills for Cisco Certificated Network Associate exam using official Cert Guide from Wendell Odom and hands on practice with Cisco Packet Tracer and Eve-ng. My roadmap is to certified in Enterprise networking at professional and expert level using Cisco learning track.

I am a big advocate for Open Source, I use Linux based Operating Systems, Applications or softwareâ€™s to home lab or run home network solution like pfSense for firewall, Raspberry Pi (pi-OS) for DNS and so on.

Idea to have this blog post, to store the documentations of home labs and connect with like-minded individuals to grow professionally. Once again, I thank you for taking time to be here and I stay connected with me I am always available on Networking Community called [The Art of Network Engineering](https://artofnetworkengineering.com/) through their discord group.
